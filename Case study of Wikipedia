Development Model:
Wikipedia follows a collaborative and open development model. It is built on the wiki platform, which allows anyone with internet access to edit and contribute to its content. This open model is referred to as "wikiwiki," where users can create, edit, and modify articles collectively. Wikipedia's content is developed and maintained by a diverse global community of volunteers who are passionate about sharing knowledge.

Licensing:
Wikipedia's content is primarily licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA) license. This license allows anyone to use, share, and adapt Wikipedia content for both commercial and non-commercial purposes, as long as they provide proper attribution and release any derivative works under the same license.

Mode of Funding:
Wikipedia relies on a combination of funding sources, primarily donations from individuals and grants from organizations. The Wikimedia Foundation, a nonprofit organization, oversees the financial aspects of Wikipedia and its sister projects. Wikipedia typically runs annual fundraising campaigns to solicit donations from its users to cover operational costs. It is committed to remaining ad-free, relying on donations to maintain its independence and neutrality.

Commercial Use:
Wikipedia's content can be used for commercial purposes, as long as users adhere to the CC BY-SA license terms. This means that businesses and organizations can freely use Wikipedia content in various ways, such as incorporating it into their websites, marketing materials, or products, provided they attribute the source and share any derivative works under the same license.

Non-Commercial Use:
Wikipedia's content is also available for non-commercial use. Educational institutions, researchers, non-profit organizations, and individuals can access, use, and adapt Wikipedia content for educational, research, or informational purposes without charge, as long as they comply with the license terms, including proper attribution.

In summary, Wikipedia's unique development model, open licensing, donation-based funding, and flexibility for both commercial and non-commercial use have contributed to its status as a valuable global resource for accessing and sharing knowledge.
